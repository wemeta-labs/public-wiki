# Which Metaverse should I play?

The quantity and variety of Metaverses is growing enormously month over month. With this growth, it can be overwhelming to filter through and find the right Metaverse for your needs. This article aims to disambiguate the different kinds of Metaverses, as well as provide associated resources for each one.

### Metaverse as a Platform

Certain Metaverses excel as platforms on which land owners and players can build. Sometimes these Metaverses offer only rudimentary geography - instead creating powerful game engines and building & terraforming tools for others to harness. These Metaverses are quite popular as they enable others to craft and shape their own digital visions.&#x20;

### Metaverse as a Game

Some Metaverses, while still fundamentally platforms, more tightly control what can be owned and built. These Metaverses still offer incredible upsides, though player & owner freedom is more controlled or restricted by the game design of that Metaverse.

### Metaverse as a Gallery

Some Metaverses excel at showcasing art work, architecture, and other digital assets. These 'hype' Metaverses are often used to house player-owned NFTs for showcasing to the world at large.&#x20;

### Pocket Metaverses

Many of the Metaverses listed above are continuous - that is, Land owned by different people exists on the same (mostly) continuous geography of that Metaverse. Pocket Metaverses, by contrast, are still virtual spaces - but they no longer exist on the larger continuous geography of the Metaverse. Animal Crossing Islands, individual Minecraft Servers, and Rec Room games are historical examples of Pocket Metaverses.
